This is because the asymptotic approach in this case is completely invalid for larger values of $\\gamma$ (approaching 1), where the massive associated entropic force would cause the end of the chain to leave the bottom of the potential well, even though it may be quite strong.

The potential is considered sufficiently distant when the length of center of the potential well to the end of the chain experiencing it is much larger than the expected end-to-end length of the chain. This disparity in length is only typically possible considering weak potentials.

Notably, the asymptoic approach appears to succeed for sufficiently distance potentials for any value of $\\varpi$. This is because the freely-jointed chain model has inextensible links, so even a stiff potential that is distant ($\\eta/N_b\\varpi\\gg 1$) will not stretch the chain past $\\gamma=1$. For chain models which have extensible links, the link stiffness will compete with the potential stiffness, such that the potential would need to be weak ($\\varpi\\gg 1$) in addition to distant ($\\eta/N_b\\varpi\\gg 1$) in order for the asymptotic approach to become accurate."
